# Hello Jane,
Thank you for reaching out.

I understand that you took effort and time to complete your pre-work tasks. As much as we would like to provide you with the opportunity, we need to follow certain eligibility criteria for the role. We make sure to add them in the application form for applicants to see them when filling it out.

CodePath already runs classes in Haiti and plans to expand its reach to other countries. If we can have the privilege to run a class in your country, we would be glad to see your application and offer you our courses.

Sincerely, <br>
Ian Raye <br>
